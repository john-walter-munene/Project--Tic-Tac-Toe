# Project--Tic-Tac-Toe

## Intro:
This is a simple tic tac toe game. Two players can get down to having fun. The game will check for winners on every new play round, and will also count cumulative winners, showcasing the pro gamer. It also prints out every turn's winner and the over score. Have fun!

## Skills Demonstrated:
From a programmer's perspective, this project is a blend of several JavaScript concepts. These include Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE), factory functions, objects, and object constructors. It also showcases a improved development concepts like code encapsulation (abstraction), meaning I have very little global code. For single objects that need only appear once, I've used IIFE, and for many of such, I have factory functions. 

Additionally, the project reflects industry software development patterns like separation of software logic and its presentation. As such, the game is fully functional on the console. Then, players interact with the game from separate UI logic. I've also included short comments to ensure any developer can reveiew my code easily, and extend it if they want to.
